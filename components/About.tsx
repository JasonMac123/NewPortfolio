      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated with a degree in <span>Chemistry</span>, after spending a
        year in the industry. I decided to pursue programming. I{" "}
        <span>
          learned and developed my skills in full-stack web developing
        </span>{" "}
        after enrolling in Lighthouse Labs. The reason why I pursued programming
        was that I loved creative aspect of turning my ideas into software or
        websites and the puzzle/problem solving side of programming. My core web
        development skills is{" "}
        <span>React, typescript, javascript, HTML, and CSS</span>. I am familiar
        with Java and .NET. I am always looking to learn and develop my skills,
        but if I&apos;m not coding then you can probably find me playing
        volleyball or at a sports game.
