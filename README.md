My personal portfolio website that shows my projects, describes me, and displays my skills!

## Description

This website displays my projects, skills, and shows my timeline of how I became a web developer. This website is designed with motion framer where a lot of the website has animations when rendered. People are able to redirect into my projects that I am proud to show off. Please check out the live website.
